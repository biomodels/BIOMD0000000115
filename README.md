Another model from _Hormone induced Calcium Oscillations in Liver Cells Can Be
Explained by a Simply One Pool Model._ Anatomy of a single Ca2+ spike.
Figure4A has been simulated by COPASI4.0.20(development). However, the
simulated figure is slightly different from the paper, single spike of Ca2+ is
around "6" time arbitrary units instead "9" time arbitrary units displayed in
the paper.
